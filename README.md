# About the project
This repository contains the code for my bachelor's degree project on measuring and estimating hand anthropometric features based on 3D scanned meshes. The project aimed to diagnose diseases such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome with acceptable accuracy. Utilizing Python, the code performs the following steps: projecting the 3D meshes to 2D, measuring keypoints, transforming back to 3D to measure volume and circumference, and cleaning the data. The code was written with the goal of providing healthcare professionals with a tool to diagnose hand conditions more accurately
